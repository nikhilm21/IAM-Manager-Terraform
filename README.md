![IAM Manager with Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/IAM%20Manager%20with%20Terraform-Automate%20Access%20Management-blue.svg)

Welcome to the IAM Manager with Terraform repository! This project simplifies Identity and Access Management (IAM) by automating user and policy management using Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code (IAC) tool. Manage AWS IAM users, groups, and policies with ease.

## Overview

### Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define IAM resources and policies in code, allowing for version control and reproducibility.
- **User Management**: Automate the creation, modification, and deletion of IAM users.
- **Group Management**: Create and manage IAM groups for simplified access control.
- **Policy Management**: Define and enforce IAM policies for fine-grained permissions.
- **Terraform Modules**: Utilize reusable Terraform modules for IAM resource provisioning.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version 0.12 or higher)
- AWS CLI with appropriate access credentials and IAM roles.

## Getting Started

Automate IAM management with Terraform in just a few steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilm21/IAM-Manager-Terraform.git
   cd IAM-Manager-Terraform

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**:

Ensure your AWS credentials and configuration are properly set up. You can configure AWS CLI credentials using aws configure.

3. **Customize IAM Configuration**:

Modify the main.tf file to define IAM users, groups, and policies according to your requirements.

4. **Initialize and Apply**:

Run the following Terraform commandsL: 

   ```shell
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
5. Manage IAM Resources:

After applying the configuration, IAM resources will be created and managed automatically.

## Usage

This repository streamlines IAM management by automating user and policy provisioning. Customize IAM configurations to align with your organization's access control policies.
